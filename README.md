## ABOUT

Hi, I'm Rwiddhi, currently a PhD research fellow with Dr. Michael Kampffmeyer at the Department of Physics and Technology, Arctic University of Norway. Previously, I spent two wonderful years in Lugano, Switzerland, pursuing an MSc. in Artificial Intelligence at the Universit√† della Svizzera italiana. My research interests include semi-supervised learning in computer vision, particularly distance metric learning and few shot learning. 


### WORK

1. A Review and Refinement of Surprise Adequacy, [published](https://conf.researchr.org/home/deeptest-2021#event-overview) at the DeepTest workshop in the International Conference of Software Engineering (ICSE), 2021.
2. [Contributing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06724) to the [ML Reproducibility Challenge 2020](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020):


###OTHER

I write (I want to say) frequently on the literature I'm reading in artificial general intelligence, the philosophy of AI, and the nature of computation here. If I'm really feeling like it, I could also probably write on what music I'm listening to (or playing on my Alhambra), or what Pasolini film I'm currently hyping to my friends.
