<h1 style="font-size:25px;">ABOUT</h1>
<p>
Hi, I'm Rwiddhi, currently a PhD research fellow with Dr. Michael Kampffmeyer at the Department of Physics and Technology, Arctic University of Norway. Previously, I spent two wonderful years in Lugano, Switzerland, pursuing an MSc. in Artificial Intelligence at the Universit√† della Svizzera italiana. My research interests include semi-supervised learning in computer vision, particularly distance metric learning and few shot learning. 
</p>

<h1 style="font-size:25px;">WORK</h1>
<p>
1. Paper accepted at CVPR 2023! We <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09352"> propose</a> hyperspherical embeddings to reduce hubness and improve the state of the art in transductive few shot learning. 
<br>
2. A Review and Refinement of Surprise Adequacy, <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/deeptest-2021#event-overview">published</a> at the DeepTest workshop of the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), 2021. 
<br>
3. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06724">Contributing</a> to the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020">ML Reproducibility Challenge 2020</a>.
</p>

<h1 style="font-size:25px;">OTHER</h1>
<p>
I write (I want to say) frequently on the literature I'm reading in artificial general intelligence, the philosophy of AI, and the nature of computation <a href = "https://rwchakra.substack.com/?utm_source=discover_search">here</a>. Some of my deep learning tutorials can be found <a href = "https://medium.com/me/stories/public">here</a>. If I'm really feeling like it, I could also probably write on what music I'm listening to (or playing on my Alhambra), or what Pasolini film I'm currently hyping to my friends.
