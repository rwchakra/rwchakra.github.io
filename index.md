Hi, I'm Rwiddhi, currently a PhD research fellow with Dr. Michael Kampffmeyer at the Department of Physics and Technology, Arctic University of Norway. Previously, I spent two wonderful years in Lugano, Switzerland, pursuing an MSc. in Artificial Intelligence at the Universit√† della Svizzera italiana. My research interests include semi-supervised learning in computer vision, particularly distance metric learning and few shot learning.
